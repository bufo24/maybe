These are some frequently asked questions about moving Maybe to an open source product.

**Q: What connection sources do you use for banks?**
A: Currently the app uses Plaid and Finicity, but those can be a hassle for those that want to self host. As an alternative we’re adding Teller as a connection provider due to their free tier being a nice option for those that want to self-host.

**Q: Have you thought about X provider? Will you support Y country?**
A: The goal is to have a wide array of connection providers to choose from that cover nearly every financial institution. This will take quite a bit of work so PRs are more than welcome!

**Q: Have you thought about rewriting [part of the stack] in [stack that you prefer]**
A: There’s still a lot of work to get the app functioning again. Since this is an open source project you’re more than welcome to fork and re-write in whatever stack makes you happy!

**Q: Where is the price data for assets coming from?**
A: The app currently uses Polygon.io, we’re open to adding more data source options though and PRs are highly encouraged. Keep in mind that we’re aiming to keep this self hostable, so the provider should have a nice free tier if possible.

Q: I’m trying to run the app locally and running into errors and issues. What should I do?
A: First checkout the existing issues to see if someone else has already reported it. If your issue hasn't previously been reported then please create an issue and provide as much detail around your machine/setup, steps performed, and debugging attempts to date.
