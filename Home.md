Welcome to Maybe. We're glad you're here!

## How to Contribute

We are in the early days of a rebuild in Ruby on Rails right now.

To be an effective contributor at this point, you will need two things:

1. [Read our Vision](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/wiki/vision)
2. An open mind and a high level of autonomy to identify high-value contributions that get us closer to the vision of a "OSS Personal Finance OS"

## What to Contribute?

For the 10,000-foot overview, [read the vision](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/wiki/vision).  For some quick guidelines, here are a few ideas to help get started:

- Full features that align with the Vision are welcomed
- Early on, we are aggressively _limiting_ additional Gems, CI/CD processes, and other overhead that adds complexity
- Testing is welcomed, but 100% code coverage is not a priority.
- We favor simplicity over optionality

## We are a WIP!

You may find incomplete areas of this wiki. You may find incomplete areas of the codebase.

We're a tiny team taking on an ambitious goal of building the complete, open-source personal finance OS alongside the community.

To survive, we have to:

- Write code fast
- Make decisions fast
- Embrace a WIP mentality

If you're down with that, [join our Discord](https://link.maybe.co/discord) and jump in on the fun!
