## A Note to self-hosters

We understand how important it is to make self-hosting easy for our community and we have made it our long term commitment.

That said, we are still _very early_ in our rebuild from Next.js to Rails.

For the time being, we are prioritizing development work over self-hosting so that one day, our self-hosters can have something substantial to use!

Thank you for your patienceâ€”we will update this guide as we get closer to our first release!

## Miscellaneous Notes (temporary)

- If you're looking for a good email sending service, [Resend](https://resend.com) is a great option for personal use as they have a very generous free plan.
