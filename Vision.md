## What is the broad vision?

We are building a "COSS Personal Finance OS" (commercial, open-source personal finance operating system)

What does this mean?

We're hard at work to figure this out, but here's a "quickstart":

- Personal finance tools that grow with your life circumstances
- A "self-service" toolbox to help you make better decisions about your money

Think of it in terms of "Maybe Core" and "Maybe Apps":

- **Core** - the "building blocks" of personal finance
  - Sign up individually and add your family
  - Add your accounts (checking, savings, credit card, loans, equity, crypto, etc.)
  - Manage your transactions (rules engine, quick search, categorization, notes, etc.)
- **Apps** - only choose what you need at your _current stage of life_
  - Insights and Reporting (net worth, income and expenses by category, key ratios)
  - Budgeting
  - Goal setting
  - Retirement planning
  - Investment tracking

## Why should I care as a contributor?

We're in the early days of a Rails rebuild, but we are NOT starting from _scratch_.

Maybe 1.0 was written in a different framework and ecosystem, but we built a solid data model and some solid abstractions and patterns for dealing with personal finance.

Our goal is to "lift and shift" many of these ideas to Rails.

## From Maybe 1.0 -> Maybe 2.0
