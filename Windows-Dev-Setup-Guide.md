For Windows development, we recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux as this closely resembles the architecture the final app is deployed to in production.

Follow the steps below to get that setup.

## Install WSL

Open Powershell and run:

```sh
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

Restart your computer as instructed, set your username and password, and run "Ubuntu" to use the WSL shell.

## Follow Ubuntu Setup Guide

From here, you should be able to follow the [Linux setup guide](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/wiki/Linux-Dev-Setup-Guide) to get started.
